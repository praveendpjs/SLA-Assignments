            In a bowl, shred the freshly cooked or leftover chicken pieces and keep them aside.

            In a large pan, heat oil. Add the finely chopped onions, and green chillies and sauté.

            Next, add in the ginger-garlic paste and stir.

            Add the chilli powder, turmeric powder, and garam masala. Mix and sauté well until the raw smell goes.

        <li>
            Add in the diced tomatoes and stir until soft.

        </li>
        <li>
            Break two eggs, and add in the salt. Stir the eggs well until cooked completely.

            Next, add the shredded chicken and chicken curry (if using), and stir well. Mash and mince the chicken and
            egg well for about two to three minutes till the parotta absorbs the flavours.
